# QPSK

Simulations will be performed starting from simple modulations to more complex transceivers involving carrier and symbol phase offsets and channel fading.

Each simulation will include a block diagram, a matlab file and a gnu radio flow chart.

The immediate milestone will be to transmit and receive the text message using the actual radios.
