This message is going to be transmitted and recovered using differential QPSK as its modulation scheme. These ascii characters will be converted into bits and randomized. Sync bytes will then be appended to the binary sequence. The message will then be deferentially encoded into QPSK symbols. We begin with a simple simulation to illustrate the ascii characters to QPSK symbol encoding and the modulation and demodulation of the QPSK symbols. We then incrementally add complexity to our simulation first by including carrier frequency and symbol timing offsets. Then we simulate channel fading. When these symbols are recovered through the simulations we will then turn to a real-life scenario by transmitting and receiving this message using the limesdr mini
